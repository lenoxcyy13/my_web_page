        <div class="lyrics">
            I'd heard there was a secret chord<br>
            That David played and it pleased the Lord<br>
            But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
            Well, it goes like this<br>
            The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift<br>
            The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<p>
            Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
            You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
            Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya<br>
            She tied you to the kitchen chair<br>
            She broke your throne and she cut your hair<br>
            And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<p>
            Well baby, I've been here before<br>
            I've seen this room and I've walked this floor<br>
            I used to live alone before I knew ya<br>
            And I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br>
            And love is not a victory march<br>
            It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<p>
            Well, maybe there's a God above<br>
            But all I've ever learned from love<br>
            Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya<br>
            And it's not a cry that you hear at night<br>
            It's not somebody who's seen the light<br>
            It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<p>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
